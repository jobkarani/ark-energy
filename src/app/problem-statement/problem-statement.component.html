That is enough solar power to be consumed throughout the world in the decades to come. Sadly, Africa has only tapped into 1% of its solar energy potential. Even sadder, 80.3% of Africaâ€™s population lacks access to electricity. We believe in providing necessary and innovative solutions to catalyze the adoption and actualisation of solar energy in Africa.</p>
